Original prompt: היית באמצע לעשות את הקוביה והמשחק ונתקעת אתה יכול להמשיך בבקשה? לא יודע מה היה התכנון תזרום פשוט

- Added Play solve session panel (start scramble + auto timer) and solve stats persisted in localStorage.
- Added isSolved tracking + timer stop on solved; scramble no longer counts in history.
- Added fullscreen toggle (F) for cube viewport.
- Added render_game_to_text + advanceTime hookup for Playwright.
- Added shared time formatter.
- Installed playwright dev dependency.
- Ran Playwright client on http://127.0.0.1:5174, verified cube renders and state JSON updated.

TODO:
- Validate timer start/stop logic in real play (manual key/move sequence).
- Consider exposing solve session controls on Learn page if desired.
- Fixed idle queue: enqueueMoves now triggers startNextMove immediately so moves fire when buttons/keys pressed.
- Fixed timer UI to re-render while running (interval tick).
- Initialized cubejs solver before scramble/startSolve to avoid silent failures.
- Added short-solution check (1-2 moves) before calling optimal solver.
- Added visual facelet mapping + mismatch detection (dev/test) and tests; fixed move rotation sign to align with cubejs.
- Added scramble fallback generator + solver init on startup.
- Timer now starts on first user move after session (source tracking).
- Added Playwright regression runner + smoke/full suites.
- Extended optimal solver short-depth BFS to <=4.
- Added tests for visual mapping + scramble fallback + optimal short solution.
- Playwright suites run; fullscreen skipped when unsupported.
- Fixed EnterCube color mapping to standard (U=white, D=yellow) + added test to assert facelets match cubejs solved.
- Upgraded optimal short-solve to meet-in-the-middle (<=6 moves) with cache.
- Added additional Playwright scenario for Learn hint application.
- All vitest tests passing; Playwright smoke + full suites pass (fullscreen skipped if unsupported).
- Added strict orientation normalization for EnterCube: map colors to faces, then rotate only via legal cube rotations (x/y/z). Reject impossible center orientation; updated tests accordingly.
- loadFromFacelets now uses validated/normalized facelets directly (no extra upright rotation) and shows a short success status message.
- Optimal short-solver increased to meet-in-the-middle depth 4 (guarantees optimal up to 8 moves) and test added.
- Added Playwright scenario to verify invalid EnterCube orientation is rejected.
- Ran `npm run test:run` (all tests pass) and `npm run test:playwright:smoke` + `npm run test:playwright` (fullscreen skipped if unsupported).
- Reverted EnterCube mapping to preserve user orientation (center-based mapping); removed strict rotation normalization.
- Added CameraCapture component (live video + grid + capture + retake + next face) with color matching utility.
- Added colorMatch unit tests and updated validation tests for preserved orientation.
- Updated EnterCube UI with camera panel, center color summary, and updated info text.
- Added vercel.json and updated .gitignore + README.
- Updated Playwright enter-cube scenarios to check load status + invalid centers error.
- Ran `npm run test:run`, `npm run test:playwright:smoke`, `npm run test:playwright` (fullscreen skipped).
- Added CameraCapture component with live grid + capture/retake/next face, and color matching via HSL/brightness heuristic.
- EnterCube now preserves orientation mapping by centers (no auto-rotation). Updated info text and center summary.
- Added `vitest.config.ts` and moved Vite test config out of `vite.config.ts` so `npm run build` succeeds.
- Updated .gitignore, README, and vercel.json for deployment.
- Playwright enter-cube scenario now checks status success + invalid centers error.
- Ran `npm run build`, `npm run test:run`, `npm run test:playwright:smoke`, `npm run test:playwright` (fullscreen skipped).
- GitHub repo created: https://github.com/meniwap/rubikubesolver
- Vercel CLI installed and logged in; initial deploy attempted (build fixed locally).
- Added FaceletPreview 3D cube in Enter page to visualize current entered colors live; uses OrbitControls to rotate.
- Ran `npm run test:run` and `npm run test:playwright:smoke` after preview addition.
- Added camera calibration workflow: sample each sticker color to build a calibration map for more reliable white detection.
- Camera capture now uses calibration if available; added UI chips and reset button in Enter page.
- Added colorMatch test to ensure calibrated mapping is used.
- Ran `npm run test:run` after calibration changes.
- Added mirror toggle for camera capture to fix left/right inversion; sampling respects mirror setting and video preview flips.
- Ran `npm run test:run` after mirror change.
- Changed mirror behavior: keep video natural, only flip capture sampling via “היפוך צילום” toggle to avoid mirrored controls.
- Ran `npm run test:run` after mirror behavior update.
- Adjusted mirror toggle to only flip the 2D previews (last capture grid + manual face grid) without altering capture data; 3D preview remains accurate.
- Ran `npm run test:run` after preview-only mirror change.
- Renamed Enter page path to /scan with redirect from /enter; nav label now "Scan" and page title in Hebrew.
- Added persistent draft storage for scan state (colors, selection, calibration, mirror) in localStorage; added explicit reset button.
- Updated Playwright paths to /scan. Ran `npm run test:run` and `npm run test:playwright:smoke`.
- Synced scan center colors to play/learn rendering by storing faceColors in game state and using them in CubeScene materials.
- loadFromFacelets now accepts faceColors to preserve scanned color scheme across modes; scramble/startSolve keep existing colors.
- Added faceColors to render_game_to_text payload for debugging.
- Ran `npm run test:run` and `npm run test:playwright:smoke` after changes.
- Fixed PlayPage reset handler to keep faceColors after scan-based load; build now passes.
